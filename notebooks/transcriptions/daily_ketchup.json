{"text": " After a few weeks, he didn't see any recovery, muscle recovery. So he said, very likely that I will have to be paralysed for life. What goes through your head though, when this information is given to a man? Initially, there was a lot of denial that this actually was going to happen. All my friends are riders. All of us have been through accidents, even some major ones. My friend banged his body into a tree and his rib punctured his lungs. It was quite bad. But after a few months, he still managed to recover and he's back on his feet. So how long did it take for you to be discharged from the hospital? I was in hospital for a total of about six months. Months? One month in the ICU, one month in high dependency, and then just one month in a normal ward before they had space in the rehab. Actually, what is physiotherapy? Just exercises. Because I still have my deltoids and my biceps, but my triceps are paralysed and I have only wrist extension. So I can move my wrist this way, but if I flip my hand around, I can't move my wrist. No way! Wow! Oh, I see, I see. Oh! So in terms of what you can do with your limbs, what can you do? What can I do? Right now, I can push my own chair, but not very well. It's like maybe on a flat surface, it's fine. Once there's a bit of a slope or unevenness, then I struggle a bit. So you can use your hands, it's just that the strength is not there. I can use my arms, but my fingers are paralysed. So I can't really pick things up. Like if I drop my phone on the floor, I can't pick it up.
