  "text": " Yeah, I feel that way sometimes as well, but I don't think I've ever hit a midlife crisis. It's scary as hell. I'm sure. I don't think I've ever hit a midlife crisis. We should have already, right? I don't know if everyone gets it. That's the thing. I think not. If you're supremely confident in yourself, you won't. Yeah, and if you're happy with where you are, you won't. What do you think, Adrian? I'm sure you've come across many people who have hit this midlife crisis. If it's a career crossroad and they're figuring out what... I think that's very common. But the crisis, maybe not crisis. Maybe just mid-career. What are people quitting their jobs in their mid-40s? I'm sure they are, right? We've seen that. We've seen that. But whenever there's a midlife crisis, we always have this idea of someone going out and buying a sports car. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's something drastic. But I think if you manage your career strategy correctly, you probably will not hit the crisis, crisis level. But sometimes it's not you. Sometimes the environment foists itself on you. Like, for instance, suddenly there's a 2008 great financial crisis, right? Crisis, yeah. And then sometimes like SARS. So sometimes our careers are put on hold and not throughout doing. And that triggers a career crisis as well. So the best thing you have to do is to be prepared for such contingencies, have to back up. And one thing I always tell people I meet is, you know, what happens if you get retrenched tomorrow? Worst case scenario. Do you have a plan? What if one morning you go to work and you receive an email from HR and the boss saying, Can you drop by our office at 5pm today? We need to discuss. And bring a box. Oh, bring a box. That's it, man. Bring a box. I'm okay to do it. But that happens, right? Yeah. So then the question is, what are you going to do? Do you have a backup plan? And if you don't have a backup plan and if you don't have enough money to last you three to six months, then a crisis could happen.",
