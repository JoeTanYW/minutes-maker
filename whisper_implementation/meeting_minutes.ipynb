    "\n",
    "5. **Attendees**:\n",
    "- Introduce a new section titled \"Attendees\". Divide this section into three parts: \"Members Present,\" \"Guests,\" and \"Absentees.\"\n",
    "- For each person listed, include their full name, title, or role within the organization, and their department if applicable. This ensures clarity on who was involved and their capacity.\n",
    "- Example:\n",

    "- These roles are crucial for accountability and reference, as the Chairperson guides the meeting's flow, and the Secretary ensures all discussions and decisions are accurately documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Formatting Tips**:\n",
    "- Use bullet points or a numbered list for the Attendees section to enhance readability.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Action Description**:\n",
    "   - For each action item, begin with \"Action:\" followed by a detailed description of the task. This description should be clear and specific, outlining what needs to be done. Avoid vague language to ensure that the action can be executed without additional clarification.\n",

    "# Experiment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audio Corpus\n",
    "We will be using an English excerpt from the IMDA National Speech Corpus (NSC). The aim of this transcription, and subsequent minutes generation, is to test the latest `large-v3` Whisper model on the __Singlish__ Accent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be testing it on the sample ID `3030` from the `NSC` dataset. This sample contains a conversation between a Singaporean Male and Singaporean Female. The exact lexicon used in the conversation recording includes Singlish phrases i.e. 'aiya', 'leh', 'lah'. We will be testing the model's ability to transcribe these phrases accurately. NSC provides:\n",
    "- Speaker 1's Audio\n",
    "- Speaker 2's Audio\n",
    "- Overall Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transcription Corpus\n",
    "The NSC also provides a transcription of the audio corpus. We will be using this to compare the model's transcription accuracy. NSC provides:\n",
    "- Speaker 1's Transcription\n",
    "- Speaker 2's Transcription\n",
    "\n",
    "This will greatly aid our efforts when comparing the efficacy of the text-level speaker diarization later on. Do note that the transcription is given using the TextGrid format. From my initial analysis, it seems to conform with some variation of SSML. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "We will be using the latest `large-v3` model offered by OpenAI, running it on the CPU (due to lack of CUDA GPU on my current system), and analysing the transcription accuracy. If we deem that it is up to standard, then we can proceed to __Speaker Diarization__. Else, we may put plans in place to retrain the model on the Singlish Accent. As mentioned above, we are currently using the IMDA NSC as our audio corpus, and it's roughly 890Gb of data. We will be using a small subset of this data for the initial testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Plans\n",
    "If the model is up to standard, we will proceed to __Speaker Diarization__ and __Minutes Generation__."

      "[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  That's why it's called make them freeze. That's why it makes them frozen like that.\n",

      "[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  Then you make it like during time.\n",
      "[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Then you make it like a color. Then it becomes like Northern Lights.\n",
      "[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  Then how about the dancing effect?\n",
      "[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  Dancing effect, you make the lamp move around lah. Then it becomes moving dancing lights.\n",
      "[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  Same effect as Northern Lights.\n",
      "[02:08.000 --> 02:09.000]  That's so creative.\n",
      "[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  That's very interesting. That's the man-made Northern Lights.\n",
      "[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  So you don't need to worry about paying all the air ticket, accommodation, and all your transfer to see the Northern Lights.\n",
      "[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  That's a great idea.\n",
      "[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  And you won't get frostbite for sure.\n",
      "[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  100%.\n",
      "[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Then how about the husky dogs?\n",

      "[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  That's a creature in the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n",

    "## Label-Aware Adaptive Diarization\n",
    "\n",
    "With the strategy of updating chunks to include strides (for incorporating past and future context), the next step involves implementing a function to iterate through this modified chunk list for diarization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backstride**: Elements from the past stride\n",
    "- **Forwardstride**: Elements from the future stride\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, an enhancement will be integrated where each chunk, upon submission, will carry the respective speaker labels for the preceding `a` elements, enriching the context for improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Consider the initial chunked list and its updated version with a stride `a=2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial list**: `[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [18, 19, 20, 21]]`\n",
    "- **Updated with stride**: `[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For diarization, beginning with chunk 1 (`0<=i<x`), specifically the second chunk `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`, the last `a=2` speaker labels from the `backstride` will be incorporated into the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, for instance, the speaker labels for elements `4` and `5` are `Speaker 1`, this provides the Language Model (LLM) with valuable historical context from the previous diarization session, enabling more precise diarization results.\n"
