    "\t\n",
    "\t1. **Document Title and Header**: Start your document by labeling it as \"Meeting Minutes\" followed by the specific name of the meeting. This title should be bold and centered at the top of the page. For example:\n",
    "\t- Meeting Minutes: Quarterly Budget Review Meeting\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t2. **Meeting Title**:\n",
    "\t- Below the document title, write \"Meeting Title:\" and then specify the exact purpose of the meeting. Choose a title that reflects the main objective or the broad area of discussion. This helps in identifying the focus of the meeting at a glance.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t3. **Date and Time**:\n",
    "\t- Next line, label \"Date and Time:\". Here, you will provide when the meeting occurred. Use the format \"Month Day, Year, from HH:MM AM/PM to HH:MM AM/PM.\" For virtual meetings across different time zones, specify the primary time zone and consider noting a few others for reference.\n",
    "\t- Example: \"March 12, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM EST (GMT-5)\"\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t4. **Location**:\n",

    "\t- Example for a virtual meeting: \"Virtual - Zoom Meeting, ID: 123-456-789, Link: [Zoom Meeting Link]\"\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t5. **Attendees**:\n",
    "\t- Introduce a new section titled \"Attendees\". Divide this section into three parts: \"Members Present,\" \"Guests,\" and \"Absentees.\"\n",
    "\t- For each person listed, include their full name, title, or role within the organization, and their department if applicable. This ensures clarity on who was involved and their capacity.\n",
    "\t- Example:\n",
    "\t  ```\n",
    "\t  Members Present: John Doe, Finance Director; Jane Smith, Budget Analyst\n",
    "\t  Guests: Alex Johnson, External Auditor\n",

    "\t\n",
    "\t7. **Formatting Tips**:\n",
    "\t- Use bullet points or a numbered list for the Attendees section to enhance readability.\n",
    "\t- Maintain consistency in font and formatting throughout the document. Use a clear, professional font like Times New Roman or Arial, size 12.\n",

    "\t\n",
    "\t2. **Itemizing Each Agenda Item**:\n",
    "\t   - List each agenda item as discussed during the meeting. Use a new sub-header for each item, which can be numbered or bulleted, depending on your preference. The title of each agenda item should be concise but descriptive enough to understand the topic at a glance.\n",

    "\t\t ```\n",
    "\t\t 1. Budget Overview for Q2\n",
    "\t\t ```\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t3. **Presenter**:\n",
    "\t   - For each agenda item, clearly identify the presenter or lead discussant. Write \"Presenter:\" followed by the individual's name and title. This assigns responsibility and provides a point of contact for follow-up questions.\n",
    "\t   - Example:\n",
    "\t\t ```\n",
    "\t\t Presenter: Jane Doe, Chief Financial Officer\n",
    "\t\t ```\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t4. **Discussion Summary**:\n",
    "\t   - Beneath the presenter, provide a summary of the discussion for that agenda item. Start with \"Discussion Summary:\" and then bullet or paragraph your summary. This should capture the key points discussed, significant viewpoints expressed, and any rationale behind decisions or opinions.\n",
    "\t   - Keep it concise but informative. Avoid unnecessary detail but ensure that someone who wasn't at the meeting can grasp what was discussed.\n",
    "\t   - Example:\n",

    "\t\t Discussion Summary:\n",
    "\t\t - Reviewed the Q2 budget projections and identified potential overspending areas.\n",

    "\t   - Action items should be clear and actionable, with a specific outcome in mind. This clarity helps in follow-up and accountability.\n",
    "\t   - Example:\n",
    "\t\t ```\n",
    "\t\t Action Items:\n",
    "\t\t - John Smith to prepare a detailed report on potential overspending areas by April 15, 2024.\n",

    "\t\t ```\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t6. **Repeat for Each Agenda Item**:\n",
    "\t   - Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each agenda item discussed during the meeting. Ensure each item is clearly separated and labeled for easy navigation through the document.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t7. **Formatting Tips**:\n",
    "\t   - Use headings and subheadings to organize the section and each agenda item. Consider using bold or italicized text to differentiate between titles, names, and the body text.\n",
    "\t   - Bullet points are useful for summarizing discussion points and listing action items, as they enhance readability.\n",
    "\t   - Maintain a consistent structure for each agenda item to help readers quickly find information.\n",
    "\t\n",

    "\t\n",
    "\t3. **Decision Title**:\n",
    "\t   - Start with \"Decision Title:\" followed by a succinct title that captures the essence of the decision. This helps readers quickly identify the decision’s subject matter.\n",

    "\t3. **Action Description**:\n",
    "\t   - For each action item, begin with \"Action:\" followed by a detailed description of the task. This description should be clear and specific, outlining what needs to be done. Avoid vague language to ensure that the action can be executed without additional clarification.\n",

    "# Experiment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audio Corpus\n",
    "We will be using an English excerpt from the IMDA National Speech Corpus (NSC). The aim of this transcription, and subsequent minutes generation, is to test the latest `large-v3` Whisper model on the __Singlish__ Accent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be testing it on the sample ID `3030` from the `NSC` dataset. This sample contains a conversation between a Singaporean Male and Singaporean Female. The exact lexicon used in the conversation recording includes Singlish phrases i.e. 'aiya', 'leh', 'lah'. We will be testing the model's ability to transcribe these phrases accurately. NSC provides:\n",
    "- Speaker 1's Audio\n",
    "- Speaker 2's Audio\n",
    "- Overall Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transcription Corpus\n",
    "The NSC also provides a transcription of the audio corpus. We will be using this to compare the model's transcription accuracy. NSC provides:\n",
    "- Speaker 1's Transcription\n",
    "- Speaker 2's Transcription\n",
    "\n",
    "This will greatly aid our efforts when comparing the efficacy of the text-level speaker diarization later on. Do note that the transcription is given using the TextGrid format. From my initial analysis, it seems to conform with some variation of SSML. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "We will be using the latest `large-v3` model offered by OpenAI, running it on the CPU (due to lack of CUDA GPU on my current system), and analysing the transcription accuracy. If we deem that it is up to standard, then we can proceed to __Speaker Diarization__. Else, we may put plans in place to retrain the model on the Singlish Accent. As mentioned above, we are currently using the IMDA NSC as our audio corpus, and it's roughly 890Gb of data. We will be using a small subset of this data for the initial testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Plans\n",
    "If the model is up to standard, we will proceed to __Speaker Diarization__ and __Minutes Generation__."

    "\n",
